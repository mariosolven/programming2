Structured Programming
======

## Programming Paradigms

It is a technological proposal that is adopted by a community of programmers whose central nucleus is questionable as to what it univocally tries to solve one or several clearly defined problems.  

## Classification of Programming Paradigms  

The declarative programming language always describe the desired end result, instead of showing all the steps of the work. 

Now imperative programming (instruction-oriented paradigm), in this case the developer determines with precisition in the source code the steps the computer must take to achieve the result. Is better described as "how" of the solution.  

+ Declarative
··* Functional: When we use this paradigm we will be working mainly on functions, as it is a declarative paradigm we will focus on what we are doing  
··* Data flow: define applications as "black box" process networks, which exchange data through predefined connections by message steps, where the 
connections are specified externally to the processes  
··* Logic: studies the use of logic for problem solving and control over the rules of inference to achieve automatic solution. 
Unifies terms, uses automatic inference mechanisms and has a logical vision of computing.  
··* Templated: This paradigm is based on solving a problem dividing it into smaller problems. By dividing into simpler problems, the aim is to obtain an easier solution.
··* Based: It is aimed at improving the clarity, quality and development time of a computer program, using subroutines and three 
··* Structures: sequence, selection (if and switch) and iteration (for and while).  

+ Imperative  
··* Von Neumann: describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of a processing unit containing a logical arithmetic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and a program counter, a memory for storing both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.

In summary is the programming which storage the data in a common memory, each memory cell of the machine is identified with a unique number and each program runs sequentually.  

··* Interpreted: In this programming paradigm, an interpreter is required and unlike other programming languages in the interpreted language, the source code is not compiled once, but every time an instruction is compiled.  

+ Object-oriented: 
It is used to design applications and computer programs, it is based on various techniques including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.

Some examples of object-oriented programming are C++, C#, Java, Perl, Ruby, etc.  

## Methods of Programming Paradigms

- Interpreted Programming:  
Unlike compiling, it does not need to be preprocessed by a compiler, that is, it executes the sequence of instructions without the need to read and translate everything.  
   
- Compiled programming:
It is a programming language whose implementations are normally compilers (translators that generate machine code from the source code). The keyword that describes a compiled pogramming is the compiled do like a step else (first you write te code and after that code is translated to bytecode and after a language that the machine can understand. 

## Source Code

It is a set of lines of text with the steps the computer must follow to run a program. Is wrote in a programming language but is not ready to execute, it needs to be translated by a compiler.  

## Data Representation in Structured Programming Language

It refers to the form in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted.

**Characteristics**

- Identifiers

··· An identifier is a string of alphanumeric characters that begins with an alphabetic character or an underscore character that are used to represent various programming elements such as variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions and so on. Actually, an identifier is a user-defined word.

- Variables

··· Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program. For example, assume you want to store two values 10 and 20 in your program and at a later stage, you want to use these two values.
